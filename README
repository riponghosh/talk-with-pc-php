INTRODUCTION
------------

Hey!
Thanks for downloading CatBot.
CatBot was originally created as a non-memory-intensive HTML-based alternative to a
popular PERL chatterbot, Leviathan, that was created by AiChaos, Inc.  My goal was to
create a very simple HTML/PHP chatterbot.

As I have released this version of CatBot under the GPL/GNU license, feel free to change
things, add more commands, etc. With a little tweaking here or there, he would make a nice
support desk assistant. I simply ask that you do not make any money off of him. I don't - 
with the exception of donations, and I would rather that other people don't profit from my work.

Remember - this is entirely a volunteer thing. This isn't what I do for a living. If you need
help, first try and figure it out yourself. If that fails, try harder. And if you still can't
seem to get it, you may email me at funkycat32 -at- gmail -dot- com, and I'll try and help you
as much as I can.

Have fun,
Cody J.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

A Web Server (tested with Apache v.2.2.2)
PHP (tested with v.5.1.4)
MySQL (tested with v.4.1.7)



INSTALLATION
------------

1) Unpack the zip file and upload its contents to your web server.
2) Make sure that the file 'log.txt' is writable.
3) Run the setup. There is a link on index.php if you have not run it yet, or
   you can run setup.php directly.
4) You can edit the logo if you wish. I've included a PSD file in the /images subfolder.
5) Have fun!



SUPPORT
-------

Figure it out yourself.
(But if that fails, email me at funkycat32 -at- gmail -dot- com)



DONATIONS
---------

I'm always accepting money from anyone who wants to give some to me. :P
If you downloaded CatBot, and you like what you see, and if you're feeling particularily
nice, you can Paypal me a couple of dollars at funkycat32 -at- gmail -dot- com.

If you donate money at SourceForge, I set half of it to go to Sourceforge and half to
go to the Apache Software Foundation. If you really want the money to go to me, 
you can use Paypal.
